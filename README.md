# stack_paranthesis
A program to check if parenthesis are balanced in a string - based on a Stack ADT. The stack capacity will double when it becomes full - this prevents overflow. 
## stack function documentation - stack.h
This is my implementation of a Stack  ADT which lives on the heap. 
### public member functions
push - adds an element to the top of the stack <br>
pop - removes an element from the stack <br>
peak - returns the top element of the stack <br>

print - prints contents of the stack <br>
clear - resets the stack <br>
size - returns the size of the stack <br>
to_vector - converts the stack to an std::vector <br>
